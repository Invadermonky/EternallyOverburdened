Have you ever wanted to torture your modpack players by adding a system that changes that innocuous stack of features into the literal straw that broke the camel's back? If yes, than this mod is for you!

Eternally Overburdened adds a highly configurable carry weight system to Minecraft that features fully customizable item weights and an overburdened system with scaling penalties and injuries.

## 🎒 Carry Weight

In Eternally Overburdened, players have a set maximum carry weight. This value can be increased or decreased based on the player's equipment, enchantments, and potion effects. Equipment, enchantment and potion bonuses can all be configured independently and will stack with one another.

Item weights are defined globally or on a per-item basis and will also include the weights of any fluids or items contained. This means that the weight of a bucket of water is equal to the weight of the bucket plus the weight of the liquid water. 

While under the carry weight limit, players will pick up items normally. Once that limit is reached, items will no longer pick up passively and will need to be interacted with directly to pick them up. However, any amount carried over the limit will result in the player becoming overburdened.

## 💪 Overburdened

When a player exceeds their maximum carry limit, they are afflicted with a new Overburdened status effect. While overburdened, players will suffer from penalties such as disabled sprinting, reduced movement speed, reduced jump height, sinking while in water, and increased fall damage. These penalties increase based on the amount of weight they are carrying.

At high levels of Overburdened, players have a chance of being injured when moving or taking fall damage.

## 🩸 Injuries

Injuries have a chance of occurring when excessive fall damage is taken while overburdened. The amount of fall damage taken and the amount of weight the player is carrying both increase the chance of an injury.

While injured, players will be afflicted with reduced movement speed, reduced jump height, and increased fall damage. If an injury is left untreated, moving around has a chance to exacerbate the injury, increasing the duration by a small amount.

Injuries can be treated and removed by crafting and using a Splint.
